THE COMPANY
Our background is rather unusual for doing hydronic systems, we are not tradesmen nor engineers, but more a DIY focused, but always looking to improve the hydronic system.
We have long advocated for zoning in hydronic systems. While zoning was rarely seen in practice, it makes perfect sense for efficiency and effectiveness. 
Home owners rarely turn down or off circuits manually to rooms not being used, it really seemed rather wasteful.
We installed various zoning systems available on the market; however, they were often simple and limited in application. 
Leveraging our programming skills, we worked on a controller that could manage every room or area independently and automaticallyâ€”a perfect solution for an effective and efficient heating and cooling hydronics system.

After several iterations, we designed and manufactured our own controller that works with any manifold. This controller is built with functionality and ease of installation in mind and integrates seamlessly into the home automation platform Home Assistant, making it smarter than any traditional smart thermostat.
