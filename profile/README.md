THE COMPANY

Our background in hydronic systems is quite unconventional. We are not tradespeople or engineers; instead, we are DIY enthusiasts who are always striving to enhance hydronic systems. 
One of our key advocacies has been the implementation of zoning in these systems. Although zoning was rarely utilized in practice, we recognized its potential for improving efficiency and effectiveness. It often seemed wasteful that homeowners rarely turned off or adjusted circuits manually for unused rooms.

We explored various zoning systems available on the market, but found them to be often simplistic and limited in their applications. To address this, we leveraged our programming expertise to develop a controller capable of managing each room or area independently and automaticallyâ€”an ideal solution for an efficient heating and cooling hydronics system.

After several iterations, we successfully designed and manufactured our own controller that is compatible with any manifold. This controller prioritizes functionality and ease of installation, seamlessly integrating into the home automation platform Home Assistant, making it smarter than any conventional smart thermostat.
